Welcome to Healthelper! This project aims to provide a convenient solution for patients who are facing health issues but are unable to meet the doctor offline. With Healthelper, patients can book doctors online and have virtual consultations using their devices (tablet, phone, or laptop) through video calling, all at affordable prices.
